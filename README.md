Inheritance Mapping in Hibernate
Inheritance mapping is a powerful feature in Hibernate that allows you to map Java class hierarchies to database tables. This technique is essential for modeling real-world entities that share common properties while also having unique attributes.

Table Per Subclass (Joined Strategy):
Table Per Concrete Class (Table Per Class Strategy):
